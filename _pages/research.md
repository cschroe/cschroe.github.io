## Job Market Paper
["Real Effects of Credit Supply Shocks: Evidence from Danish Banks, Firms, and Workers"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qqpvkbzdtt91vub/schroeder_jmp.pdf?dl=0) with [Simon Juul Hviid](https://www.nationalbanken.dk/en/research/economists/Pages/Simon-Juul-Hviid.aspx)

Abstract: Recent evidence points to significant, real effects of reductions in firms' credit supply during the 2008/2009 financial crisis on firm level employment, yet little is known how these shocks affected the composition of firms' labour inputs and outcomes at the worker level.  In this paper we use bank-firm-worker matched data from Denmark to explore the role that firm credit supply played in explaining patterns of employment and worker outcomes during the Great Recession.  We identify a relative drop in lending from Danish banks that were particularly exposed to the financial crisis.  We then show that firms primarily connected to more exposed banks pre-crisis were unable to cover the reduction in credit by accessing financing from alternate sources, and that this was accompanied by a significant drop in employment.  Negative employment effects were concentrated amongst firms with low pre-crisis liquidity, and on employment of nonmanagerial workers and workers in middle-skill occupations.  At the worker level, positive effects on unemployment and negative effects on earnings are largely borne by workers employed in low-skill occupations in 2007 suggestive of skill upgrading within the workforce.

"Does Wealth Inhibit Criminal Behavior? Evidence from Swedish Lottery Winners" with [Erik Lindqvist](https://sites.google.com/site/eriklindqvistsse/) and [Robert Östling](https://sites.google.com/view/robertostling)

Abstract: A large literature documents that people with low income are more prone to commit crime. While social scientists have come up with a wide range of theories accounting for the relationship between criminal and economic status, convincing empirical evidence on the casual effect of wealth or income on crime is scant. In this paper, we use data on Swedish lottery players to investigate how positive wealth shocks affect criminal behavior. Matching players to their children, we also estimate the effect of parental wealth on children’s delinquency. The lottery data offer two key advantages: First, because we observe the factors conditional on which lottery wins are randomly assigned, we are able to use only the exogenous variation in lottery wins. Second, the large number of winners (over 400,000) implies estimates are precise. To limit concerns of data mining, we specify all key aspects of the statistical analyses in a pre-analysis plan before undertaking any analyses. We expect the plan to be made public in November 2020.
