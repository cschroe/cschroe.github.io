## Job Market Paper
["Real Effects of Credit Supply Shocks: Evidence from Danish Banks, Firms, and Workers"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qqpvkbzdtt91vub/schroeder_jmp.pdf?dl=0) with [Simon Juul Hviid](https://www.nationalbanken.dk/en/research/economists/Pages/Simon-Juul-Hviid.aspx)

Abstract: Decreases in credit supplied to firms negatively affects their level of employment, yet little is known how these shocks affect the occupational composition of firms' labour inputs and outcomes at the worker level.  This paper investigates the effects of bank distress on the provision of credit, and its effect on employment beyond firm level aggregates.  We use a novel bank-firm-worker matched dataset built from Danish administrative and tax records to identify a reduction in bank lending during the Great Recession.  Danish banks that were particularly exposed to the 2008/2009 financial crisis cut lending to firms, and firms were unable to compensate the reduction in credit with financing from alternate sources.  The decrease in credit supply led to a drop in firm level employment with effects concentrated amongst firms with low pre-crisis liquidity, and on employment of nonmanagerial workers and workers in middle-skill occupations.  At the worker level, effects vary by occupational skill group.  Workers employed in low-skill occupations experienced larger positive effects on the probability and duration of unemployment, and negative effects on earnings.  Workers in middle-skill occupations experienced more modest effects on unemployment but also a more immediate positive effect on new employment.  Our findings suggest that workers in low-skill occupations experience adverse effects on the labour market, even when the share of employment in these occupations is increasing.

"Does Wealth Inhibit Criminal Behavior? Evidence from Swedish Lottery Winners" with [Erik Lindqvist](https://sites.google.com/site/eriklindqvistsse/) and [Robert Östling](https://sites.google.com/view/robertostling)

Abstract: A large literature documents that people with low income are more prone to commit crime. While social scientists have come up with a wide range of theories accounting for the relationship between criminal and economic status, convincing empirical evidence on the casual effect of wealth or income on crime is scant. In this paper, we use data on Swedish lottery players to investigate how positive wealth shocks affect criminal behavior. Matching players to their children, we also estimate the effect of parental wealth on children’s delinquency. The lottery data offer two key advantages: First, because we observe the factors conditional on which lottery wins are randomly assigned, we are able to use only the exogenous variation in lottery wins. Second, the large number of winners (over 400,000) implies estimates are precise. To limit concerns of data mining, we specify all key aspects of the statistical analyses in a pre-analysis plan before undertaking any analyses. We expect the plan to be made public in November 2020.
