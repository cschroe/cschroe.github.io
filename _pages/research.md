"Does Wealth Inhibit Criminal Behavior? Evidence from Swedish Lottery Winners" with [Erik Lindqvist](https://sites.google.com/site/eriklindqvistsse/) and [Robert Östling](https://sites.google.com/view/robertostling)

Abstract: A large literature documents that people with low income are more prone to commit crime. While social scientists have come up with a wide range of theories accounting for the relationship between criminal and economic status, convincing empirical evidence on the casual effect of wealth or income on crime is scant. In this paper, we use data on Swedish lottery players to investigate how positive wealth shocks affect criminal behavior. Matching players to their children, we also estimate the effect of parental wealth on children’s delinquency. The lottery data offer two key advantages: First, because we observe the factors conditional on which lottery wins are randomly assigned, we are able to use only the exogenous variation in lottery wins. Second, the large number of winners (over 400,000) implies estimates are precise. To limit concerns of data mining, we specify all key aspects of the statistical analyses in a pre-analysis plan before undertaking any analyses. We expect the plan to be made public in November 2020.
