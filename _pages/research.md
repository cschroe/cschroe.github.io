Abstract: Bank lending cuts can lead firms to reduce their level of employment, yet little is known how these shocks affect the composition of firms' employees and outcomes at the worker level.  This paper investigates the effect of bank distress on the provision of credit, and its effects on employment beyond firm level aggregates.  To do so, we use a novel dataset built from administrative and tax records linking all banks, firms, and workers in Denmark.  We show that banks that were particularly exposed to the 2008/2009 financial crisis cut lending to firms, and firms were unable to fully compensate with financing from alternate sources. The decrease in credit supply led to a drop in firm level employment with effects concentrated amongst firms with low pre-crisis liquidity, and on employment of nonmanagerial workers and workers in middle-skill occupations. At the worker level, effects varied by occupational skill group: workers employed in low-skill occupations experienced larger increases in unemployment and decreases in earnings. Workers in middle-skill occupations experienced more modest increases in unemployment but also a more immediate increase in the probability of starting a new job. Our findings suggest that workers in low-skill occupations experienced the brunt of adverse effects on the labour market, even while the share of employment in these occupations was increasing.

"*Does Wealth Inhibit Criminal Behavior? Evidence from Swedish Lottery Winners*" with [Erik Lindqvist](https://sites.google.com/site/eriklindqvistsse/){:target="_blank"} and [Robert Östling](https://sites.google.com/view/robertostling){:target="_blank"}

A large literature documents that people with low income are more prone to commit crime. While social scientists have come up with a wide range of theories accounting for the relationship between criminal and economic status, convincing empirical evidence on the casual effect of wealth or income on crime is scant. In this paper, we use data on Swedish lottery players to investigate how positive wealth shocks affect criminal behavior. Matching players to their children, we also estimate the effect of parental wealth on children’s delinquency. The lottery data offer two key advantages: First, because we observe the factors conditional on which lottery wins are randomly assigned, we are able to use only the exogenous variation in lottery wins. Second, the large number of winners (over 400,000) implies estimates are precise. To limit concerns of data mining, we specify all key aspects of the statistical analyses in a pre-analysis plan before undertaking any analyses. We expect the plan to be made public in December 2020.
