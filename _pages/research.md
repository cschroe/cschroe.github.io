Bank lending cuts can lead firms to reduce their level of employment, yet little is known how these shocks affect the composition of firms' employees and outcomes at the worker level.  This paper investigates the effect of bank distress on the provision of credit, and its effects on employment beyond firm level aggregates.  To do so, we use a novel dataset built from administrative and tax records linking all banks, firms, and workers in Denmark.  We show that banks that were particularly exposed to the 2008/2009 financial crisis cut lending to firms, and firms were unable to fully compensate with financing from alternate sources. The decrease in credit supply led to a drop in firm level employment with effects concentrated amongst firms with low pre-crisis liquidity, and on employment of nonmanagerial and low-educated employees.  At the worker level, we find that positive effects on unemployment were driven by effects on nonmanagerial, low-educated, and short-tenured workers, as well as workers in low-skill occupations.  Our estimates suggest that cuts in bank lending can account for up to 6% of the fall in total employment, and are an important factor behind heterogeneous employment dynamics in times of contractionary credit.

A large literature documents that individuals with low income are more prone to commit crime. While social scientists have come up with a wide range of theories accounting for the relationship between criminal and economic status, convincing empirical evidence on the casual effect of wealth or income on crime is scant. In this paper, we use data on Swedish lottery players to investigate how positive wealth shocks affect criminal behavior. Matching players to their children, we also estimate the effect of parental wealth on children’s delinquency. Our data offer two key advantages: first, as we observe the factors conditional on which lottery wins are randomly assigned, we are able to isolate and utilize the exogenous variation in lottery wins. Second, the large number of winners (over 400,000) implies estimates are precise. To limit concerns of data mining, we specify all key aspects of the statistical analyses in a pre-analysis plan before undertaking any analyses.

["*A Model of Search in Credit and Labour Markets with Heterogeneous Workers*"](https://cschroe.github.io/files/schroeder_bank_labour_search.pdf){:target="_blank"}

How do frictions in credit markets affect firms' choices over which workers to hire?  To study this question, I build a search and matching model of credit and labour markets with heterogeneous labour.  Firms first search for a bank to cover the costs of posting a vacancy.  Firms that secure financing then search for workers of varying skill in the labour market.  Upon meeting a worker the firm faces a trade-off: hire that worker in the present period and produce output, or wait for a potentially higher skilled worker to come along.  Firms' optimal behaviour is determined by tightness in the labour market, itself determined by frictions in both credit and labour markets.  Greater credit market frictions drive labour market tightness down, leading firms to seek higher skilled workers.
