I am an Analyst at the European Central Bank and hold a PhD in Economics from the Stockholm School of Economics.  My research interests are broadly within the fields of labour economics and finance.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained an MSc from the Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin and a BA & BComm from the University of Calgary.
