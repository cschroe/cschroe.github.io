I am a PhD Student in Economics at the Stockholm School of Economics.  I have research interests in labour economics and finance.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained an MSc from the Humboldt Universit√§t zu Berlin and a BA & BComm from the University of Calgary.

I am on the job market in 2020/2021.  You can find my CV [here](https://cschroe.github.io/files/schroeder_cv_jm.pdf).
